### What is this?

This started as a collection of personal configuration files: .bashrc, .gitignore, etc.

I never used it much because I never wanted to look too deeply into that stuff, and I wasn't really organized enough.

As of today (8.16.2017), Nothing has been updated in over 4 years. Since shortly before I started Pratt, actually.

Anyway, I'm organized now, I want to document how to set up a server. Entirely. I'm going to start over after writing this.

Anyway. I found the file I was looking for. setup.bash



### What else is there to say?

.emacs, .emacs.d : configuration file and directory for emacs. Could use some work.
.gitconfig, .gitignore : for .git
.bash_profile, .bashrc, .inputrc, .profile: bash files

supervisord: just for starting supervisor

setup.bash: this is what i was looking for.

.js : for some sort of Chrome extension? js files to run on websites.
